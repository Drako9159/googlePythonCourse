# In this lab, you'll change the username of your coworker 
# Jane Doe from "jane" to "jdoe" in compliance with company's 
# naming policy. The username change has already been done. 
# However, some files that were named with Jane's previous username "jane" 
# haven't been updated yet. To help with this, 
# you'll write a bash script and a Python script that will take 
# care of the necessary rename operations.
